# Getting Started 

First of all, you must run the db.json and it works on automatically 3000th port. You should write this command to start db.json `npx json-server --watch db.json`. After the run of db, you have to install libraries with "npm install" command then you can run the project with "npm start" command. You will be prompted with this question 
"Something is already running on port 3000.
Would you like to run the app on another port instead?" 
you should choose "Y" button.
